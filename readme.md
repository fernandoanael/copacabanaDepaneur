## About CopacabanDepaneur

CopacabanaDepaneur is a fake, example only, extremely simple and minimalist Depaneur System Management. It was made for a DataBase College presentation at Montreal, QC.  

## Technologies

CopacabanaDepaneur uses a MySQL database, Laravel as the backend and HTML, SASS, and VueJS in the front-end.

## Contributing

As said before this is a fake, example only, extremely simple and minimalist Depaneur System Management, so besides the College presentation goal, it can be used for learning how to built a simple aplication using Laravel and Vue. Feel free to fork it a look at the code to understando how everything works.
